//we can tell if its std.out or std.err, we have a different stream for
// handling errors which have dev benefits, the third standard stream
// is standard in much more touchy we will use it later with a package


//console.log is essentially a standard output 
//which is wrapped in dev convenience


//process.stdout.write("Hello world"); 
this is going straight to the i/o no console
